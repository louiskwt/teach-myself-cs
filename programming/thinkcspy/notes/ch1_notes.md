# high-level vs low-level programming languages

- Some defnintions 

> A programming language like Python and C++ that is designed to be easy for humans to read and write. (high-levels)
> A programming language that is designed to be easy for a computer to execute; also called machine language or assembly language.

- For high levels languages, it is either complied or interpreted:

> Compling means to translate a program written in a high-level language into a low-level language all at once, in preparation for later execution.

> Interpreting means to execute a program in a high-level language by translating it one line at a time. But modern interpreters, sometimes also called a runtime-environment or virtual machine, are much more complicated: evaluating whole sections of source code at a time, caching and optimizing where possible, and handling complex memory management tasks. An interpreted language may also be pre-compiled to a lower-level intermediate language or bytecode, similar to assembly code.

# Errors

## Run-time errors
An error that does not occur until the program has started to execute but that prevents the program from continuing.

## semantic error¶
An error in a program that makes it do something other than what the programmer intended.

## syntax error
An error in a program that makes it impossible to parse — and therefore impossible to interpret.
