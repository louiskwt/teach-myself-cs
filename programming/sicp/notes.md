## Key ideas

All computing begins with representing information, specifying logic to process it, and designing abstractions that manage the complexity of that logic.

Every powerful language has three such mechanisms:

primitive expressions and statements, which represent the simplest building blocks that the language provides,
means of combination, by which compound elements are built from simpler ones, and
means of abstraction, by which compound elements can be named and manipulated as units.

In programming, we deal with two kinds of elements: functions and data. (Soon we will discover that they are really not so distinct.) Informally, data is stuff that we want to manipulate, and functions describe the rules for manipulating the data. Thus, any powerful programming language should be able to describe primitive data and primitive functions, as well as have some methods for combining and abstracting both functions and data.

### Abstraction

What's abstraction? Abstraction is a mean to hide implementation details so that as long as the input and expected output don't change, how the abstraction is implemented is not relevant and other developers or programmaers can simply utilise the abstacted piece of code without worrying about the underlying details. Overall, abstraction helps modularise code to improve maintainability for programmers who develop the code and usability for other developers who rely on it in their programs.

- Types of abstraction:
  - Functional Abstraction: grouping combined computational elements and process as a single function
  - Class Abstractoin: grrouping combined computational elements and process as a single class

## Guide to designing function

- give each function exactly one job
- don't repeat yourself (DRY). Impelment a process just once, but execute it many times
- define functions generally

## Higher Order Functions

- Functions that manipulate functions are called higher-order functions. This section shows how higher-order functions can serve as powerful abstraction mechanisms, vastly increasing the expressive power of our language.

- decorators are hofs

## Lambda

When the function returned by the lambda expression is called, the return expression of a lambda expression executed.

- Lambdas can return other lambdas!

## Recusion

Recursion is a technique used for creating a function that is defined in terms of itself. It means that if a recursive function will call itself when it was executed. The gist of recursion is that it has to have base case defined so that it will eventually return, and when the fucntion calls itself, it does so with a smaller or simpler set of input so that the function will eventually reach the base case and return.

The order of a recursive function is that all the recursive calls have to return before the first function frame that trigger the recursive call can proceed.

When recursively processing lists, the base case is often the empty list and the recursive case is often all-but-the-first items.

A tree recursive function is a recursive function that makes more than one call to itself, resulting in a tree-like series of calls.

## object

An object is a bundle of data and behavior.

A type of object is called a class.

Immutable vs. Mutable

- An immutable value is unchanging once created.

Immutable types (that we've covered): int, float, string, tuple

A mutable value can change in value throughout the course of computation. All names that refer to the same object are affected by a mutation.

Mutable types (that we've covered): list, dict

A default argument value is part of a function value, not generated by a call.

Each time the function is called, s is bound to the same value.

## Closure

it refers to the property of a data type

A method for combining data values has a closure property if the result of combination can itself be combined using the same method. Closure is the key to power in any means of combination because it permits us to create hierarchical structures — structures made up of parts, which themselves are made up of parts, and so on.

e.g. a list can hold another list as an element

## Object Oriented Programming

The Python object system is designed to make data abstraction and message (State) passing both convenient and flexible.

We would like to use the object system to promote a separation of concerns. Each object in a program encapsulates and manages some part of the program's state, and each class statement defines the functions that implement some part of the program's overall logic. Abstraction barriers enforce the boundaries between different aspects of a large program.

Object-oriented programming is particularly well-suited to programs that model systems that have separate but interacting parts.

On the other hand, f–unctional abstractions provide a more natural metaphor for representing relationships between inputs and outputs. One should not feel compelled to fit every bit of logic in a program within a class, especially when defining independent functions for manipulating data is more natural.
