## Reading notes

Method or operator overloaded: it has different meanings depending upon the type of objects to which it is applied

- when * is applied to an int and a str, it becomes a repetition operator
- n*s = repeat str s n times

String in python is a non-secular object

- can be accessed using index
- slicing s[start: end]
    1. by default the start is set to 0; and the end is set to len(s)

- input will give you back a str

python map

- map(f1, list) apply f1 to every item in the list
