        <h2>CS50x -- Harvard (retaken in 2024)</h2>
        <p>In this course, I leared how to program in C, Python and JavaScript. Throughout the course, I got exposure to procedual programming, some basic data structures and algorithms as well as the way to analysis the efficiency of an algorithm. With the problem sets, I learned how to solve problems by buiilding abstraction through simple primitive instructions and functions offered by a programming langauge. But most importantly, I was introducted the fundamental concept of computational thinking: taking a well-defined set of inputs to produce a definite output through a series of steps and instructions</p>
