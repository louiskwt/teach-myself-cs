# Intro

This repo serves as the public record / transcript of my self-taught CS Degree and my learning journey.

My current curriculum is based on [Teach Yourself CS]('https://teachyourselfcs.com/') and the [Open Source CD Degree]('https://github.com/ossu/computer-science').

The official start date of my self-taught CS program is May 6, 2023

Some information about myself:

    1. Before doing this program, I have taken CS50x and CS50p from Harvard as well as several courses on Coursera and Udemy

    2. While starting this program, I'm working as a full-stack developer at a startup in Hong Kong and have been programming for about 2 years.

    3. My goal for doing this program is to fill in the gap of my computer science knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of how computer actually works so that I can build sophisticated systems or applications.

# Structure of the Course (Current Coursework)

## Programming

    - SICP Book and lecture (5/8 - 8/5)

    - Revisiting the C Programming Portion of CS50 (5/7 - 6/7)

## Mathematics for Computer Science

    - Precalculus (Brusing up my math skills) (5/8 - 8/5)

# Reflection Section ðŸ’­

## 5/8 - 5/19

1. Going through SICP and CS61A lectures made me rethink the fundamental concepts of programming 

2. Picking up Precal help me understand more about functions and its raltion to programming in general

3. As the week progresses, I feel like I need to focus more on building projects and actually doing something practical with the materials I'm learning.
