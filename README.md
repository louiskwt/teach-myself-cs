# Intro

This repo serves to record my (self-taught) CS learning journey.

My current curriculum is based on [Teach Yourself CS]('https://teachyourselfcs.com/') and the [Open Source CS Degree]('https://github.com/ossu/computer-science').

The official start date of my self-taught CS program is May 6, 2023

Some information about myself:

    1. Before doing this program, I have taken CS50x and CS50p from Harvard as well as several courses on Coursera and Udemy

    2. While starting this program, I'm working as a full-stack developer at a startup in Hong Kong and have been programming for about 2 years.

    3. My goal for doing this program is to fill in the gap of my computer science knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of how computer actually works so that I can build sophisticated systems or applications.

# Motivations / Objectives for Learning üéØ

- Build an open source learning management system for tutors and self-employed teachers

- Develop an open courseware for DSE and IELTS students

- Conduct research on using AI and Machine Learning to help students keep track of their learning progress with feedback
 

# Curriculum & Courses üìñ

## Programming

    - CS61A Summer 2023

## Mathematics for Computer Science

    - Precalculus

# Reflection Section üí≠

## 5/8 - 5/19

1. Going through SICP and CS61A lectures made me rethink the fundamental concepts of programming 

2. Picking up Precal help me understand more about functions and its raltion to programming in general

3. As the week progresses, I feel like I need to focus more on building projects and actually doing something practical with the materials I'm learning.

## 5 / 20 - 6 / 03

1. SICP and CS61A offered me a better framework to reason about abstraction and tackle programming problems. Overall, I really enjoy doing the homework problems and lab assignments.

2. Studying Math somehow helps me understand better about Higher Order Function.

3. Moving forward, I would like to take more notes so that I can remember what I have learned.

## 6/03 - 7/02

1. Finished A Coursera course on Precalculus and learned a lot from it
2. Taking SICP and reading the book continued to make me a better programmer in so many aspects
3. Need to speed up my progress~

## 08/12

1. Struggled to find time to learn and study due to hectic schedule
2. Found the CS61A course to be more difficult than I think

# Resources Section üîó

## Programming

- Composing Program [book]('http://composingprograms.com/')

- CS61A [lecture video]('https://cs61a.org/')


*After a few week working with Scheme and the old version of CS61A, I switched to a more modern version of SICP with Python and the CS61A 2020 summer lecture series because the newer version of the book and lectures are easier for me to follow and more relevant to me*

## Math 

- Precalculus [textbook]('https://openstax.org/details/books/precalculus-2e')

- Precalculus Lecture [videos]('https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9OOrhA2iKak&list=PLDesaqWTN6ESsmwELdrzhcGiRhk5DjwLP') by Professor Leonard

- Precalculus Course on [Coursera]('https://www.coursera.org/learn/precalculus-relations-functions/home/week/1') 

- Khan Academy [Precalculus Course]('https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus')
