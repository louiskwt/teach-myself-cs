# Intro

This repo serves as the public record / transcript of my self-taught CS Degree and my learning journey.

My current curriculum is based on [Teach Yourself CS]('https://teachyourselfcs.com/') and the [Open Source CD Degree]('https://github.com/ossu/computer-science').

The official start date of my self-taught CS program is May 6, 2023

Some information about myself:

    1. Before doing this program, I have taken CS50x and CS50p from Harvard as well as several courses on Coursera and Udemy

    2. While starting this program, I'm working as a full-stack developer at a startup in Hong Kong and have been programming for about 2 years.

    3. My goal for doing this program is to fill in the gap of my computer science knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of how computer actually works so that I can build sophisticated systems or applications.
