# Intro

This repo serves to record my (self-taught) CS learning journey.

My current curriculum is based on [Teach Yourself CS]('https://teachyourselfcs.com/') and the [Open Source CS Degree]('https://github.com/ossu/computer-science').

The official start date of my self-taught CS program is May 6, 2023

Some information about myself:

    1. Before doing this program, I have taken CS50x and CS50p from Harvard as well as several courses on Coursera and Udemy

    2. While starting this program, I'm working as a full-stack developer at a startup in Hong Kong and have been programming for about 2 years.

    3. My goal for doing this program is to fill in the gap of my computer science knowledge and gain a deeper understanding of how computer actually works so that I can build sophisticated systems or applications.

# Motivations / Objectives for Learning üéØ

- Build an open source learning management system for tutors and self-employed teachers

- Develop an open courseware for DSE and IELTS students

- Conduct research on using AI and Machine Learning to help students keep track of their learning progress with feedback
