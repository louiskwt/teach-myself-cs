## Inroduction

**Who Am I**

Hi there, this's Louis, a software developer based in Hong Kong, China. Before working at a startup as a developer, I taught English in Hong Kong. I managed to make a career change by learning how to code and picking up web development during the Covid years.

Admittedly, I dabbled in programming (a little bit of Javascript and html just for fun) while I was studying aboard in San Francisco, but I didn't take it seriously until the year of 2020.

The reason I said that upfront is to paint a realistic picture about how long it took me to get a job through self-study especially for people who are thinking about making a career switch.

**Motivation**

This repo documents my attempt to study Computer Science (CS) by adopting an outcome-oriented approach and using mainly online resources. Instead of pursing adegree (because I have already got one) or a master degree (which I cannot afford), I have decided to study on my own and continue to teach myself CS because a lot of successful developers have done the same.

However, there's a serious problem when it comes to teachinig yourself computer science: I'm overwhlemed by the amount of online courses, study guides, and learning resources available out there.

To address the issue, I asked myself this question: what if I (and probably many of those who have tried to learn CS on their own) have been approachig it wrong? Looking back, I realised that when I set out to develop the fundamentals of CS by taking a course and following a study guide, the goal of doing so (learning the CS fundamentals) is gradually replaced by just finishing the course and going through the guide. This has to do with something call a false sense of productivity.

To put it another way, I'm actaully distracted from the main objective (learning the CS fundamentals) that I had at the beginning by fixating on a proxy goal (finishing the course or going through the study guide) because completing a course and getting to the end of the study guide offers you a sense of accomplishment along with the dopamin rush. Because of that, simply aiming to learn CS / coding / web development, taking courses, or worse, pursuing a degree can go terribly wrong.

So why don't we take a step back and think from first principle? Let's say you really want to learn how to code or study CS like I do. You have to dig deeper and ask yourself why do you want that or what do you want to do by learning how to code or studying CS.

For me (as of 2024), I want to study CS because:

1. I want to be able to build large scale systems for many people to use (which is something that interests and excites me)
2. I am curious about how computer and large scale systems work under the hood
3. I found solving technical problems stimulating and rewarding and I want to be better at that
4. I want to build SAAS products that can yield enough profit and free myself from the 9-5 rat race.

See, no matter how weird, silly, "wrong", or "impractical" about what I have mentioned will turn out to be in the future, at least I now have some clear and specific goals that I can use to guide me through my learning.

That being said, the motivation of this repo is to document the learning path that I craft for myself to learn the fundamentals of CS based on the goals I have; and hopefully this will inspire people who want to learn something by themselves to also do the same.
