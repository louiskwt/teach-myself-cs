## Inroduction

**Who Am I**

Hi there, this's Louis, a software developer based in Hong Kong, China.

Before working at a startup as a developer, I taught English in Hong Kong.

I managed to make a career change by learning how to code and picking up web development during the Covid years.

Admittedly, I dabbled in programming (a little bit of Javascript and html just for fun) while I was studying aboard in San Francisco, but I didn't take it seriously until the year of 2020.

The reason I said that upfront is that I want to paint a realistic picture about how long it took me to get a job through self-study especially for people who are thinking about makign a career switch.

**Motivation**

This repo documents my attempt to study Computer Science by adopting an outcome-oriented approach and using mainly online resources.

Instead of pursing adegree (because I have alread got one) or a master degree (which I cannot afford), I have decided to study on my own since I have read and seen so many stories about how people have accomplished that on their own.

However, there's a serious problem when it comes to teachinig yourself computer science: I'm overwhlemed with the amount of online courses, study guide, and learning resources.

To address the issue, I realised that maybe I (and probably many of those who have tried to learn CS on their own) have been approachig it wrong. What does that mean? When I set out to learn computer science by taking a course and following a study guide, the goal of doing so is just to finish the course and go through the guide.

Because of that, I found that I'm actaully distracted from my main objective (learning the fundamentals of computer science) that I had at the beginning. In other words, simply aiming to learn Computer Science / Coding / Web development, taking courses, or worse, pursuing a degree are terrible because doing these neither help you achive your goal nor equip you with practical skills to do great things.

So why don't we take a step back and think from first principle? Let's say you really want to learn how to code or study Computer Science like I do. You have to dig deeper and ask yourself why do you want that or what do you want to do by learning how to code or studying computer science.

For me (as of 2024), I want to study Computer Science because:

- I want to be able to build large scale systems for many people to use (which is something that interests and exits me)
- I am curious about how computer and large scale systems work under the hood
- I found solving technical problems stimulating and rewarding and I want to be better at that
- I want to build a SAAS products that can generate me profit, freeing myself from the 9-5

See no matter how weird, silly, "wrong", "impractical" about what I have mentioned will turn out to be in the future, at least I have a clear and specific goals that I can use to guide me through my learning.
