**Progress**

The rapid advance of processors and computer technology has yielded a tremendous progress in society and made computers omipresent in our life.

- Notable ideas

    1. computer system in cars thanks to the advance in multiprocessor
	2. the web (and social media)
	3. search engine
	4. smartphones
	5. AI
	6. human genome project 

But then, my question is can the progress made in computation spread and elevate other domains as well. Yes, automobiles and some consumer technologies have got better, but in some fields such as education and transportation, I don't think the advance in comptation has not been utilised to its full potential due to some constraints (maybe energy and other human factors)
