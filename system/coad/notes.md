**Progress**

The rapid advance of processors and computer technology has yielded a tremendous progress in society and made computers omipresent in our life.

- Notable ideas

    1. computer system in cars thanks to the advance in multiprocessor
	2. the web (and social media)
	3. search engine
	4. smartphones
	5. AI
	6. human genome project 

But then, my question is can the progress made in computation spread and elevate other domains as well. Yes, automobiles and some consumer technologies have got better, but in some fields such as education and transportation, I don't think the advance in comptation has not been utilised to its full potential due to some constraints (maybe energy and other human factors)

**Three-class of Computing and Applications**

- PC (personal computers)

    - delivering good performance to a single user at a low cost 
	- it runs third-party softwares
	- it's controlled using a graphical interface as well as some IO devices such as a keyboard or mouse

- Servers

	- a computer used for running larger programs or various jobs
	- it serves multiple users often simultaneously
	- can be accessed only through a network
	- higher emphasis on dependability (achieved through redundency)
	- a crash can be more costly than than for PC
	- supercomputer is a on the high end and extreme side of server

- embedded computers
	
	- a computer integrated into another physical device 
	- used for running one predetermined application or a collection of software
	- can be found in car, train, plane and home appliances
	- a crash can be upsetting, devastating and extremely costly
	- dependability is achived through simplicity (doing a small set of jobs perfectly)

- Intersting tibit

	- TB vs TiB
	> Originally 1,099,511,627,776 (2^40) bytes, although communications and secondary storage systems developers started using the term to mean 1,000,000,000,000 (10^12) bytes. To reduce confusion, we now use the term tebibyte (TiB) for 2^40 bytes, defining terabyte (TB) to mean 10^12 bytes.

	- apparently, TB is 21% less than TiB, GB is 7% less than Gib, MB is 5% less than Mib
